A two-player Pong game controlled with capacitive displacement sensors

This code comes in two parts: one programs an Arduino microcontroller that serves as an interface between a computer and two capacitive displacement sensors. The next is Processing code that uses output from the Arduino to control two paddles of a Pong-style game.

The PDF file located at http://www.sudvarg.com/therepong.pdf includes the background behind this project and relevant circuit diagrams for building displacement sensors and configuring the Arduino.
